  abstract =	 {A computer simulation model, can produce some
                  interesting and surprising results which one would
                  not expect from initial analysis of the algorithm
                  and data. We question however, whether the
                  description of such a computer simulation modelling
                  procedure (data + algorithm + results) can
                  constitute an explanation as to why the algorithm
                  produces such an effect. Specifically, in the field
                  of theoretical biology, can such a procedure
                  constitute real scientific explanation of biological
                  phenomena? We compare computer simulation modelling
                  to explicit mathematical treatment concluding that
                  there are fundamental differences between the
                  two. Since computer simulations can model systems
                  that mathematical models can not, we look at ways of
                  improving explanatory power of computer simulations
                  through empirical style study and mechanistic
                  decomposition.},

                  basis for research or analysis. However, complex
                  systems simulation often fails to properly
                  demonstrate that the constructed simulation is an
                  adequate tool to support investigation of the system
                  under study. To address this issue, we adopt and
                  adapt argumentation techniques traditionally used
                  for safety critical systems (SCS). Here we present
                  part of an on-going case-study in which these
                  techniques are used to demonstrate that two
                  different implementations of a complex system
                  simulation are adequately equivalent. this is a
                  first step in producing further simulations of the
                  system under study, which will be shown to be valid
                  models on which to explore particular ecological
                  phenomena.},

  abstract =	 {Simulation models that describe autonomous
                  individual organisms (individual based models, IBM)
                  or agents (agent-based models, ABM) have become a
                  widely used tool, not only in ecology, but also in
                  many other disciplines dealing with complex systems
                  made up of autonomous entities. However, there is no
                  standard protocol for describing such simulation
                  models, which can make them difficult to understand
                  and to duplicate. This paper presents a proposed
                  standard protocol, ODD, for describing IBMs and
                  ABMs, developed and tested by 28 modellers who cover
                  a wide range of fields within ecology. This protocol
                  consists of three blocks (Overview, Design concepts,
                  and Details), which are subdivided into seven
                  elements: Purpose, State variables and scales,
                  Process overview and scheduling, Design concepts,
                  Initialization, Input, and Submodels. We explain
                  which aspects of a model should be described in each
                  element, and we present an example to illustrate the
                  protocol in use. In addition, 19 examples are
                  available in an Online Appendix. We consider ODD as
                  a first step for establishing a more detailed common
                  format of the description of IBMs and ABMs. Once
                  initiated, the protocol will hopefully evolve as it
                  becomes used by a sufficiently large proportion of
                  modellers.},

@article{Lavorel&Garnier02,
  abstract =	 {The concept of plant functional type proposes that
                  species can be grouped according to common responses
                  to the environment and/or common effects on
                  ecosystem processes. However, the knowledge of
                  relationships between traits associated with the
                  response of plants to environmental factors such as
                  resources and disturbances (response traits), and
                  traits that determine effects of plants on ecosystem
                  functions (effect traits), such as biogeochemical
                  cycling or propensity to disturbance, remains
                  rudimentary.  We present a framework using concepts
                  and results from community ecology, ecosystem
                  ecology and evolutionary biology to provide this
                  linkage. Ecosystem functioning is the end result of
                  the operation of multiple environmental filters in a
                  hierarchy of scales which, by selecting individuals
                  with appropriate responses, result in assemblages
                  with varying trait composition. Functional linkages
                  and trade-offs among traits, each of which relates
                  to one or several processes, determine whether or
                  not filtering by different factors gives a match,
                  and whether ecosystem effects can be easily deduced
                  from the knowledge of the filters.  To illustrate
                  this framework we analyse a set of key environmental
                  factors and ecosystem processes. While traits
                  associated with response to nutrient gradients
                  strongly overlapped with those determining net
                  primary production, little direct overlap was found
                  between response to fire and flammability.  We
                  hypothesize that these patterns reflect general
                  trends. Responses to resource availability would be
                  determined by traits that are also involved in
                  biogeochemical cycling, because both these responses
                  and effects are driven by the trade-off between
                  acquisition and conservation. On the other hand,
                  regeneration and demographic traits associated with
                  response to disturbance, which are known to have
                  little connection with adult traits involved in
                  plant ecophysiology, would be of little relevance to
                  ecosystem processes.  This framework is likely to be
                  broadly applicable, although caution must be
                  exercised to use trait linkages and trade-offs
                  appropriate to the scale, environmental conditions
                  and evolutionary context. It may direct the
                  selection of plant functional types for vegetation
                  models at a range of scales, and help with the
                  design of experimental studies of relationships
                  between plant diversity and ecosystem properties.},

  abstract =	 {In recent years, there has been a growing
                  fascination with decentralized systems and
                  self-organizing phenomena. Increasingly, people are
                  choosing decentralized models for the organizations
                  and technologies that they construct in the world
                  and for the theories that they construct about the
                  world. However, even as decentralized ideas spread
                  through the culture, there is a deep-seated
                  resistance to such ideas. In trying to understand
                  patterns in the world, people often assume
                  centralized control where none exists (e.g.,
                  assuming that a "leader bird" guides the rest of the
                  flock). To probe how people think about
                  decentralized systems and to help them develop new
                  ways of thinking about such systems, I developed a
                  programmable modeling environment called StarLogo
                  with which people can easily create and experiment
                  with decentralized systems. StarLogo allows users to
                  control the actions and interactions of thousands of
                  artificial creatures on the computer screen. I
                  describe three StarLogo projects created by
                  high-school students. Based on my observations of
                  these and other students, I analyze the nature of

@inproceedings{Ritson.etal09,
  abstract =	 {Process-oriented programming is a design methodology
                  in which software applications are constructed from
                  communicating concurrent processes. A
                  process-oriented design is typically composed of a
                  large number of small isolated concurrent
                  components. These components allow for the scalable
                  parallel execution of the resulting application on
                  both shared-memory and distributed-memory
                  architectures. In this paper we present a runtime
                  designed to support process-oriented programming
                  byproviding lightweight processes and communication
                  primitives. Our runtimescheduler, implemented using
                  lock-free algorithms, automaticallyexecutes
                  concurrent components in parallel on multicore
                  systems. Runtime heuristics dynamically group
                  processes into cache-affine work units based on
                  communication patterns. Work units are then
                  distributed via wait-free work-stealing. Initial
                  performance analysis shows that, usingthe algorithms
                  presented in this paper, process-oriented software
                  can execute with an efficiency approaching that of
                  optimised sequential and coarse-grain threaded
                  designs.},

  abstract =	 {A framework is developed to explore the connection
                  between effective optimization algorithms and the
                  problems they are solving. A number of ” no free
                  lunch” (NFL) theorems are presented which establish
                  that for any algorithm, any elevated performance
                  over one class of problems is offset by performance
                  over another class. These theorems result in a
                  geometric interpretation of what it means for an
                  algorithm to be well suited to an optimization
                  problem. Applications of the NFL theorems to
                  information-theoretic aspects of optimization and
                  benchmark measures of performance are also
                  presented. Other issues addressed include
                  time-varying optimization problems and a priori ”
                  head-to-head” minimax distinctions between
                  optimization algorithms, distinctions that result
                  despite the NFL theorems' enforcing of a type of
                  uniformity over all algorithms},
